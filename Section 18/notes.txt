* Biggest difference: arrays work elementwise
* Ndarrays have the added benefit of using built-in functions and methods

Strings vs Object vs Number
Nan = not a number
Dtype = object (exists for better compatibility with older versions of pandas package)
	b -> a python object
* Avoid specifying various datatypes when importing NumPy data
