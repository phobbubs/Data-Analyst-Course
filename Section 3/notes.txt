3 Setting up the Environment (Jupyter)

Source code (human-readable code) -> Software -> Binary (readable by computer)

Program: sequence of instructions that designate how to execute a computation
Programming: taking a task and writing it down in a programming language that the computer can understand and execute

Computer science: about understanding what computers can do
Programming: activity of telling computers what to do for us

1. Problem-solving skills and abstract thinking -> breaking down into steps
3. Mechanistic thinking - code instructions, syntax of programming language
4. Good style of coding

Language Kernels (programs designed to read and execute code in a specific language) - Python, R, Julia
Interfaces (Clients) - web browser, other interfaces

.ipynb - iPython Notebook File

Jupyter
- Test
- Code
- Output (results, figures, graphs, pictures, others)

Anaconda
- Software package that contains python and Jupiter
