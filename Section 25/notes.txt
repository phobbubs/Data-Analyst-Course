25 Data Visualisation (Introduction)

* By visualising data, we can spot patterns, which would otherwise remain hidden in a data table
* Helps us present our findings to others
* A universal language, spoken across almost every industry
* Your audience make key strategic decisions based on your data

* Excel, tableau, powerBI
* Python, R -> data viz packages

Theory
* Gather data (assume already done for you)
* Choose the right visualisation
* Visualise and style the data

Choosing the Right Visualisation

* Statistics
    * Types of data and levels of measurement

1. Categorical Data
    1. Describes categories or groups
    2. e.g. yes/no
2. Numerical Data
    1. Represents numbers

* Bar chart
    * Has several categories/bars (x axis)
    * Numerical measure (y axis)
* Pie chart
    * Similar to bar chart
* Scatter plot
    * Numerical values on both axis
* Line chart
    * Date - time series (y axis) against numerical (y axis)
* From Data to Viz (website?)

* Stay away from complex plots, keep things simple
* Don’t choose a chart that can be misinterpreted
* Don’t stay away from rudiments (simple)

Colours / Colour Theory

* Colour can greatly change how we perceive information
* Our perception of colour depends on the light
    * Also depends on interpretation of our brains
* 5-10% of humans suffer from some level of colourblindness

1. Colours can be used to convey extra information
2. Colour can enhance the appearance of our chart
    1. Too many colours is not always a good thing
    2. Don’t use more than 3 colours, ideally keep to 2 colours
3. Colours should be chosen carefully
    1. Colour theory

* Primary colours: red, blue, yellow
* Secondary colours - mix between primary colours: purple, green, orange
* Tertiary colours - others
* Colour wheel

* Saturation, Hue, Lightness, Shade, Tip, Tone, Temperature, etc.

* Screens: RGB
* Printers: CMYK

Don’t overly focus on picking colours
* Work with any dictated colour schemes

24 Data Visualisation (Charts)

Bar Chart

* A popular way to visualise data
* Among the clearest and most straightforward visual representations of information

import pandas as pd								# library for data manipulation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt						# library for visualization
import seaborn as sns								# library for visualization
sns.set()											# this command sets the seaborn chart style as the default

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter #converts values into percentage format

* Matplotlib has a default setting for chart formatting
    * Fonts, fontsize
    * Background themes
    * Etc

* Seaboard has become the preferred choice for data viz
    * Built on top of matplotlib

Pie Chart

* Avoid using pie charts
* Considered one of the worst choices for data viz
    * Human eye is not great at interpreting non-rectangular visuals
* Preferred for presenting parts of a whole (percentage)

Don’t use when
* Wrong type of data
* If there are too many categories (max 6-7)
* If data doesn’t sum up to 100%
* Applies to doughnut pie charts

Recommended to use when
* Few categories
* Adds up to 100%

sns.set_palette('colorblind')

Stacked Area Chart
Describe changes in variables over time
* Area and line charts are good options for timeline
* Used to display quantitative data for three or more numerical variables

1. Classic Area Chart
    1. Overlap among categories
2. Stacked Area Chart
    1. No overlap among categories
    2. The entire area is the sum of all categories
3. 100% Stacked Area
    1. All categories sum up to 100%
    2. No overlap among categories
4. Steam graph
    1. Displayed around a central category
    2. No overlap among categories

Stacked Area Chart
* Conveys a lot of information
* Discovers trends and patterns in the data
* Follows development of several different variables over time

When to use:
* When we have time data
* When we want to compare the volume among categories
* When we have at least 3 categories
* When the variables are ordered and numerical
* When we have no more than 6-7 categories
* Y-axis must start at 0

Line Charts

* Evolution of one or several quantities
* Represent time series data
* Focus on stock market returns

- Think about narrowing time frame

When to use:
* When displaying time series data
* When we have several different variables
    * 3, 5 or even 10 variables over time
* When displaying multiple categories

When not to use:
* When we have too many categories -> spaghetti chart

Where to start
* Does not have to start y-axis at 0

Histogram
* Shows the distribution of a numeric value
* The variables range of values is split into intervals, represented by different bins
* Height of the bins shows the number of observations within an interval

X-axis: ascending order
Y-axis: frequency of occurrence / density function

[a,b] - inclusive of a & b
(a, b] - inclusive of b, exclusive of a

Number of bins
* Depends on nature of data and its distribution
* 6-10 most feasible
* Interval width can be deliberately altered -> might allow misinterpretation

When to use:
* Start y-axis at 0
* Does not have to be numerical
    * Likert scale -> strong agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree (5-1)

Scatter Plot
Shows the relationship between two numerical features

* Can display a large number of points
* Each observation is a point on that scatter
* Our data is not aggregated

Danger of Overplotting
* Sampling should be random
* A subset small enough to avoid over plotting, but large enough to contain the data pattern
 Regression Plot
* Linear regression
    * Aim to find a hyperplane or line which best fits the data
    * Linear, exponential, logarithmic, polynomial

Regression Equation
* Slope: direction & steepness
* Intercept: the place where the regression line intersects the y-axis
* R^2: variance of data captured by the model

Bar and Line Chart (Combination Chart)
Pareto Chart
* bar chart: in descending order of frequency
* Line chart: sum of relative frequencies = cumulative frequency (sums up to 100%)

Y-axis - primary axis
- Refers to bars
- Displays number of occurrences

X-axis - secondary axis
- Refers to line chart
- Cumulative frequency
