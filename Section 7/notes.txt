7 Numpy Package

A collection of pre-written functions, classes and methods which are capable of handling and manipulating data and calculating results
Main Feature: Arrays
A type of data structures, which store elements and refer to their values via integer indices

Incredibly computationally stable and efficient
- Works in a lower-level language => shorter computation times
Pandas -> stores multiple types of data simultaneously

Use when:
- Compute a lot of values for analysis
- Deal with vectors and matrices
- Import and pre-process data into python directly
- Generate random tests

How to make use:
- N-D array class - more useful when computing values bc operations work element wise
Functions (faster than python)
- Np.function_name(ndarray)
Methods (faster than python)
- ndarray.method_name()
Operations
- Broadcasting, type casting

Terminal > pip install numpy (already installed in anaconda)
Terminal > pip install numpy â€”upgrade

N-D ARRAY = N-dimensional array
0-D array -> a single data point (scalar)
1-D array -> a sequence of values (vector)
2-D array -> a collection of 1-D sequences (matrix)
