14 Data Cleaning & Data Preprocessing

Data Cleaning / Cleansing:
* Applying certain analytical and programming techniques to convert an incomprehensible dataset into a meangingful and quality format we can use for further processing
* This step aims to fix the problems that will inevitably occur with data gathering
* After this, the computer can read the information smoothly and perform statistical and mathematical computations
* Ensure data is deprived of inconsistencies
* i.e. a bridge between 2 parts of analytical flow, programming <-> Statistics, Mathematics, Predicative Models->Visualisations, Analytical Inferences

Data Preprocessing:
* Re-categorisation of the data
* Inputing missing values
* Shuffling
* Applying statistical methods

Round 1. The ideal analytical flow: Data gathering -> Cleaning -> Pre-processing -> Visualisation
Round 2. Interactive Visual Analysis (data wrangling, munging): back nâ€™ forth

* Domain knowledge
* Analytical flow guidance
* Respect deadlines
* Prioritise quality of results
