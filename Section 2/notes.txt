API -> to retrieve data

Python - open source (free, constantly updating), general purpose (intended to provide solution for all types of problems) high-level (employing syntax close to human logic, low-level languages = machine languages -> code containing 1s and 0s) programming language - can expand focus towards next steps of analytics process, predictive and prescriptive

Data Types
Qualitative - text, descriptive, no numbers, no precise specification but approximates
Quantitative - numeric, quantifiable information, involved in statistical and mathematical computations

Analysis VS Analytics
Analysis - separation of whole into smaller, digestible components, studied individually and examined how they relate to other parts, contains past data
Analytics - future performance, logical and computation reasoning in data, explore patterns, forward looking

Business Intelligence - studies past of a company, includes CA and DA, take full advantage of relational databases
Data Science - relies on certain characteristics of business and data analytics, involves implementation of ML algos
